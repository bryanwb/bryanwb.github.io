Due to the\nreserve ratio, the amount of new money created by bank deposits\ncan be calculated with the Money Multiplier.</p>\n<p><strong>No longer true. See the New York Fed's <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/02v08n1/0205benn/0205benn.html\">article</a> on why reserve requirements are no longer binding</strong></p>\n<p>Myth number 3: national savings == national investment</p>\n<p><strong>Not really. In part because the Leverage Ratio is so large and because market forces\nactually decide where money is invested</strong></p>\n<p>Myth number 4: The U.S. dollar is backed by the gold in Fort Knox.</p>\n<p><strong>Not since 1971 when <a href=\"https://mises.org/wire/today-1971-president-nixon-closes-gold-window\">Nixon closed the Gold Window</a></strong></p>\n<p>Given that we have debunked these myths, we need to answer some glaring questions</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why do banks take deposits?</li>\n<li>Why do banks pay interest our deposit accounts when they don't actually lend out our money?\n3.. What constrains how much money banks can create?</li>\n<li>Do new loans increase a bank's capital and thus its ability to yet\nmake even more loans?</li>\n<li>How does the Fed keep interest rates low and are there risks to keeping interests rates low? (hint: quantitative easing)</li>\n<li>What happens when I transfer money in my account to another bank? What happens when\nI transfer money from a U.S. bank to one not in the United States?</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>If/when will the U.S. devalue its currency and how?</h3>\n<p>Miko thinks not but this entirely depends on the trade relationship between the U.S. and China.</p>\n<h3>Where do cryptocurrencies fit into this?</h3>\n<p>Many people in the Bitcoin community believe that Bitcoin will eventually supplant the U.S. dollar\nas the world's reserve currency. They think of Bitcoin as <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861\">a better Gold Standard</a></p>\n<h3>Summing up</h3>\n<p>How the banking system actually works defies our intuitions about it. Banking in our modern world really\nis fucking insane.</p>\n<h3>Picks</h3>\n<p>Bryan</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQui_3Hpmmc&#x26;list=PL8FB14A2200B87185\">Robert Shiller's lectures on Understanding Financial Markets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://noded.org/\">Noded Bitcoin podcast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://epicenter.tv/\">Epicenter podcast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PositiveMoneyUK\">Positive Money series</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"August 24, 2018","path":"/podcast/banking-is-insane","title":"Episode 1 - Banking is Fucking insane","tags":"podcast"}}},"pageContext":{}}

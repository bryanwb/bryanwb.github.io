Why is this show called Hot Air? Where are we?</li>\n<li>Introduce Miko</li>\n<li>Investment disclaimer</li>\n<li>Purpose of this show - discuss some of the commonly held myths\nabout banking and how they relate to discussions about cryptocurrencies</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Banking myths</h3>\n<p>Myth number one: Banks lend out depositors' money as loans.</p>\n<p>Myth number two: Banks have to keep 10% of each one dollar (Reserve Ratio) of\ndeposits and this constrains how many loans the bank can make. Due to the\nreserve ratio, the amount of new money created by bank deposits\ncan be calculated with the Money Multiplier.</p>\n<p>Myth number 3: national savings == national investment</p>\n<p>Myth number 4: The U.S. dollar is backed by the gold in Fort Knox.</p>\n<p>Given that we have debunked these myths, we need to answer some glaring questions</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why do banks take deposits?</li>\n<li>Why do banks pay interest our deposit accounts when they don't actually lend out our money?\n3.. What constrains how much money banks can create?</li>\n<li>Do new loans increase a bank's capital and thus its ability to yet\nmake even more loans?</li>\n<li>How does the Fed keep interest rates low and are there risks to keeping interests rates low? (hint: quantitative easing)</li>\n<li>What happens when I transfer money in my account to another bank? What happens when\nI transfer money from a U.S. bank to one not in the United States?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Are we currently in a bubble and if so, what is fueling it?</p>\n<p>Weird shit happening due to abnormally low interest rates:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>companies borrowing to buy back own shares</li>\n<li>asset price bubble</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How sensitive are student loans to changes in the interest rate?</p>\n<h3>If/when will the U.S. devalue its currency and how?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Massive state debt defaults over pension programs</li>\n<li>Massive student loan defaults</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Where do cryptocurrencies fit into this?</h3>\n<p>First, some history on the gold standard.</p>\n<p>Could Bitcoin or Ethereum replace the Gold Standard?</p>\n<p>Why does the Bitcoin community love the Austrian economists and focus\nso much on monetary policy?</p>\n<p>How could Bitcoin replace Gold when mining is centralized in some regards? Specifically, something like 90% of miners are in China.</p>\n<p>Who are the Austrian economists and are they sane?</p>\n<h3>Could Bitcoin replace the dollar as the world's reserve currency?</h3>\n<p>and what would that look like?</p>\n<p>How banks make loans in a Bitcoin world?</p>\n<h3>Contrarian View - What if Trump pulls off MAGA?</h3>\n<p>What if he succeeds wildly despite his utter lack of competence? What\nwould that look like? What if China suffers some major blows and the dollar gets so strong we can print money to get out of all your debt problems w/out causing\ninflation?</p>\n<h3>Summing up</h3>\n<p>How the banking system actually works defies our intuitions about it. Banking in our modern world really\nis fucking insane.</p>\n<h3>Legit or Quit</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Fractional Reserve Banking</li>\n<li>Bitcoin</li>\n<li>Ethereum</li>\n<li>Investing in Gold</li>\n<li>Tesla</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Picks</h3>\n<p>Bryan</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQui_3Hpmmc&#x26;list=PL8FB14A2200B87185\">Robert Shiller's lectures on Understanding Financial Markets</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://noded.org/\">Noded Bitcoin podcast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://epicenter.tv/\">Epicenter podcast</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/PositiveMoneyUK\">Positive Money series</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Miko?</p>","id":"59f892da-09fa-559e-b8d1-6e9bbbf63a10","excerpt":"Bryan and Miko talk about banking makes no sense and how Bitcoin comes into the picture.

I at first tried to use my editor of choice\n<a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/\">emacs</a> but was continually frustrated by\nthe mediocre support for working JavaScript, particularly compared to\nPython. After wasting at least a day trying to get my Emacs config to support\nJavaScript as well as I had it for Python I came across the blog post <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/vscode-better-editor-emacs/swizec/7921\">10 Years\nof love for Emacs Undone by one week of\nVSCode</a>. The\ntitle really struck me as I have spent exactly 10 years with Emacs myself. I decided\nto top swimming upstream and jump wholeheartedly into VS Code. It was a mixed experience.</p>\n<p>I was instantly struck how superior VS Code's support is for the JavaScript language, libraries,\nand the web environment. It got significantly better when I learned to drop <code>//@ts-check</code> in every file.\nVS Code's language support is so awesome that I highly doubt any other editor will ever seriously compete with it in that regard. At the same time, I hit a pretty significant pain point. I use emacs keybindings everywhere, in the shell, browser, you name it. On OS X, <a href=\"https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/\">Karabiner</a> mapped those bindings for me and now on linux laptop with GNOME its a top-level feature. In VS Code I foudnd that I was constantly breaking the editor with the most common commands that I use thousands of times a day. Here are just a few. I probably have ~100 in muscle memory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>M-f forward word</li>\n<li>M-b backward word</li>\n<li>C-w cut text</li>\n<li>M-w copy text</li>\n<li>C-SPACE start a selection</li>\n<li>C-a beginning line</li>\n<li>C-e end of line</li>\n<li>M-a back paragraph</li>\n<li>M-e forward paragraph</li>\n<li>C-s search forward</li>\n<li>C-j Change buffer</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I found an <a href=\"https://github.com/SebastianZaha/vscode-emacs-friendly\">emacs plugin for VS Code</a> but it only confused my muscle memory as it only supported some\ncommands and then with small annoying bugs that made the plugin more trouble than it was worth.</p>\n<p>I dropped the emacs plugin and tried to do things the VS Code way. It only kind of worked for me. As a developer, there is a whole set of things we do that are code-related but not coding per se, here are just a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Working with git</li>\n<li>Managing files</li>\n<li>Maintaining a personal TODO list and logging errors, troubleshooting information</li>\n<li>Executing shell commands</li>\n<li>Writing documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While VS Code likely has some support for these, I found the VS Code plugins in these areas lacking\nwhen I tried them. For example, I found jumping between projects with <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager\">Project Manager</a> very lacking in comparison to Emacs' incredible <a href=\"https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile\">Projectile</a>. It is important to note that the Project Manager addon may have improved significantly since I last used it. The existing git addons also pale in comparison to Emacs' fantastic <a href=\"https://magit.vc/\">git interface</a>.</p>\n<p>I am one of those crazy people that runs a terminal inside of emacs. I even have a keybinding (M-j) that\nI use to toggle between character and line mode in the terminal. VS Code's terminal is OK but nothing to write home about.</p>\n<p>I use Emacs <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html\">dired</a> mode for manipulating files and directories. It works ridiculously well.</p>\n<p>More than magit, projectile, dired, I missed emacs' <a href=\"https://oremacs.com/swiper/\">ivy</a> completion framework more than anything else. You really have to see it to believe it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/VvnJQpTFVDc\" title=\"Ivy in Action\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/VvnJQpTFVDc/0.jpg\" alt=\"Ivy in Action\"></a></p>\n<p>So far I have talked a whole lot about the Emacs features that I miss in VS Code. But surely, you ask, won't VS Code implement all of those features even better than Emacs given the VS Code teams extensive developer resources? Maybe, but I would be surprised if they did. I doubt the VS Code team intends to give it a kitchen sink of capabilities. Emacs' kitchen sink approach made it unbearably slow some decades ago. Luckily, it is ridiculously fast by today's standards since it is written in C. VS Code, written primarily in JavaScript, will bog down if they flesh it out with the capabilities I have described here.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jEwgPsd.gif\" alt=\"tide in action\">l</p>","id":"11bb0886-79c0-52c2-85f1-9dee15d91acd","excerpt":"Some months ago I decided to reorient my development career around web\ndevelopment with JavaScript.

On July 10th, 2018, I started Design of the UNIX Operating System by Maurice J. Bach

https://www.amazon.com/Design-UNIX-Operating-System/dp/0132017997

I picked up this book in Nepal in 2012 because I read somewhere that Linux Torvalds
used it as a reference when creating Linux. I have a beautiful copy only available
in South Asia for a very low discount price.

Hi! My name is Bryan Willson Berry and I have a lot of opinions and even more questions. This
website is my platform to share those opinions and to provoke questions from you, the reader.

I am a professional software engineer currently living in Bangkok, Thailand with
my wife and two children. I am American by birth but by strange accident have
lived the last 17 years in Tel Aviv, Hong Kong, Kathmandu, Rome, and now Bangkok.

I am grew up in lovely [Whittier, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whittier,_California) but moved at age 18. I sometimes think that leaving was a mistake. Whittier is a beautiful and special place.

I am fascinated by the nexus of finance and technology, particularly the
potentially disruptive impact of blockchain technology on our global financial
system.


## Things I like

### Books and lectures

I consume a lot of books, primarily in audio format. I primarily listen to non-fiction.

#### General

* [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) This book has affected me more than anything else I have read in the last 10 years. If you haven't read this one, you should drop what you're doing and go read it now.
* [Wild Swans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Swans) - the story of China's disastrous 20th century told through the eyes of 3 generations of women in a single Chinese family.

# What is This?

This page tracks my educational progress as I endeavor to learn more about Computer Science and Finance.

This page takes no small inspiration from [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

I keep notes and solutions for my self-study here

note: I quit reading Real World Haskell due to increasing frustration
with how the material was presented. 

note1: I added [Computer Science from the Bottum Up](https://www.bottomupcs.com/) as it is a nice hands-on tutorial writing low-level C programs on Linux.


To be frank, this process is more than a little daunting. I have two small children and my wife has a demanding career of her own.
This might take me five years.

## Fun projects/reading

## Blog posts I found useful

* Many, many wonderful posts by [Gustavo Duarte](https://manybutfinite.com/) on the Linux Kernel

## Tooling

When and wherever possible I will do all work in Emacs.

## Notes

fun tutorials to do should I ever get around to them

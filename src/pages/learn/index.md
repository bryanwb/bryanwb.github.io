This page tracks my progress as I learn more about Computer Science and Finance.

This page takes no small inspiration from [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

I keep notes and solutions for my self-study [here](https://github.com/bryanwb/bryanwb.github.io/tree/develop/learning)

note: I quit reading Real World Haskell due to increasing frustration
with how the material was presented. 

note1: I added [Computer Science from the Bottum Up](https://www.bottomupcs.com/) as it is a nice hands-on tutorial writing low-level C programs on Linux.

## Web Development

This is a collection of resources I have used to learn web development.

## Blog posts I found useful

* Many, many wonderful posts by [Gustavo Duarte](https://manybutfinite.com/) on the Linux Kernel

## Tooling

When and wherever possible I will do all work in Emacs.

## Notes

fun tutorials to do should I ever get around to them

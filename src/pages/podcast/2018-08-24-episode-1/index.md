### Banking myths

Myth number one: Banks lend out depositors' money as loans. <strong>False</strong>


Myth number two: Banks have to keep 10% of each one dollar (Reserve Ratio) of 
deposits and this constrains how many loans the bank can make. Due to the
reserve ratio, the amount of new money created by bank deposits
can be calculated with the Money Multiplier.

<strong>No longer true. See the New York Fed's [article](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/02v08n1/0205benn/0205benn.html) on why reserve requirements are no longer binding</strong>

Myth number 3: national savings == national investment

<strong>Not really. In part because the Leverage Ratio is so large and because market forces
actually decide where money is invested</strong>

Myth number 4: The U.S. dollar is backed by the gold in Fort Knox.

<strong>Not since 1971 when [Nixon closed the Gold Window](https://mises.org/wire/today-1971-president-nixon-closes-gold-window)</strong>

Given that we have debunked these myths, we need to answer some glaring questions

1. Why do banks take deposits?
2. Why do banks pay interest our deposit accounts when they don't actually lend out our money?
3.. What constrains how much money banks can create?
4. Do new loans increase a bank's capital and thus its ability to yet 
make even more loans?
5. How does the Fed keep interest rates low and are there risks to keeping interests rates low? (hint: quantitative easing)
6. What happens when I transfer money in my account to another bank? What happens when
I transfer money from a U.S. bank to one not in the United States?

### If/when will the U.S. devalue its currency and how?

Miko thinks not but this entirely depends on the trade relationship between the U.S. and China.


### Where do cryptocurrencies fit into this?

Many people in the Bitcoin community believe that Bitcoin will eventually supplant the U.S. dollar
as the world's reserve currency. They think of Bitcoin as [a better Gold Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861)

### Summing up

How the banking system actually works defies our intuitions about it. Banking in our modern world really
is fucking insane.

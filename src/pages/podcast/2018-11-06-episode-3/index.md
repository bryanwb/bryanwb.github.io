Bryan talks with [Agniezska Sarnecka](https://twitter.com/vanilizer) about [Neufund](https://neufund.org).

## Outline

Have Aga discuss here background, how she got into this space and why it is important to her.

Aga gives brief intro about what Neufund and security tokens. Try to keep this part short. Define a few key terms such as ETO.

## Nuts and bolts of equity ownership as it currently stands

How does the transfer of equity ownership it currently work?

Learning about equity markets I learned that current settlement process for securities is ridiculously complicated. Zoe Adamovicz gave a great explanation in a recent talk.

Can you walk me through the process of transferring the ownership of a security from one person to another? i.e. explain the roles of clearinghouses, custodians, and registars.

Which parts of this does the blockchain replace?

Which parts does Neufund replace? Does Neufund perform some of the functions of an investment banker?

## What are the drawbacks of the current system for companies and small investors?

Discussing how small companies and private investors access equity markets:

Say I am a small company in Poland, Italy, or even Thailand. How feasible is it for me to sell equity stakes in my company in Europe or the United States? (pretty infeasible) And if I can't sell equity shares in those markets what are my options to raise money to grow my business?

Say I am a private investor, located outside the U.S. can I buy equity shares traded in the US or Europe (I realize you can)? Are there any particular downsides such as having to pay U.S. capital gains tax. Might some citizens have to pay taxes again in one's own country?


## What does Neufund offer for small companies?

Why is Neufund compelling for private investors? Higher diversification in their portfolio?

What I really like about Neufund is off-chain components it brings such as creating a termsheet
and filing a prospectus. Can you explain those steps and why they are important?

Say the HotAir Podcast did an ETO, raised a bunch of money and then just walked away with the money and never did anything with the money. What would the token holders recourse be? Could I ultimately be jailed in Germany? Basically, how do you keep ETO issuers honest?

Can tokens created with the Neufund platform be sold to individuals who have not completed the KYC checks?

My understanding is that ETO tokens can be traded as any other ERC-20 token, is that correct? or must they be traded only through the Neufund platform?

Once an ETO launches, is it tied to Neufund forever or does it exist independently?

Why does Neufund require a blockchain? It seems that you could accomplish much of your current goals by simply providing a web interface that automates the creation of investment shares that conform to Vermögensanlagen? What does the blockchain really buy you here?

I assume that your KYC process creates a whitelist of Ether accounts that are stored somewhere.  Say that I am currently on the whitelist and own a bunch of ETO tokens. And say that I am truly nasty person. And say that tomorrow  I intentionally drive over your dog with my car. Could you take away my tokens? If not could you take me off the KYC whitelist so that I cannot receive dividends from my ETOs and could not buy new ETOs?

How do dividends work w/ Neufund? i.e. how does it distribute didivends. Does it act as the "Registrar"?

Dividends are paid in NEU, correct? How do NEU convert to either or euros?

How can I buy an ETO using Euros? does the Neufund platform have a mechanism for initiating wire transfers from Eurozone banks?

Are there any compelling reasons for currently listed public companies to raise funds via Neufund?

What kind of vetting do you do potential ETO issuers? What would cause you not to list a company?

## What the fork?

What happens to my ETO in case of a chain fork? My understanding is that ETO issuer(s) can decide which fork is the definitive one. What if they can't decide or what if they choose a fork that effectively takes the company private? i.e. an issuer could create a fork of one node (on their laptop!) that transfers all the 
tokens in the ETO back to themselves.

## Other security tokens

Are there any plans, ideas to interoperate, play nicely with the other companies working on security tokens? Perhaps on a common registry of tokens so that investors could easily verify the identity of a given token.

## Malta

* What is happening in Malta in regards to blockchain? Why is it important?
* Could it make ETOs more accessible to retail and institutional investors?
* Might it create laws that make the off-chain part of security tokens easier, like Vermögensanlagen 
does in Germany?

## The process of conducting an ETO

Likely won't have time for this, but could cover termsheet, prospectus, etc.


## What's next?

I believe 7 ETOs are currently running. Are those ETOs finished or still ongoing? How much did they raise if you can say?

Are those ETOs traded on any exchange besides the Neufund platform?

All the companies currently listed on your platform appear to be based in Germany. Are you open to applicants from other countries?

What is still missing on the off-chain side for ETOs?

There was a lot of talk at devcon 4 about scaling Ethereum the larger initiative of which is now called Serenit iirc. Let's presume that all those scaling initiatives fail. Does Ethereum 1.0 scale enough to meet Neufund's needs for the forseeable future?

## Conclusion

How can people learn more about Neufund and are you looking for help/collaborators? How can people get in touch with you?

I have found it fairly challenging to learn about the mechanics of how securities markets currently work, specifically how securities transfer is settled, 

I know that is a lot qs! I am sure I will come up w/ more
